                Hi, it's watrabi.

                I wanted to write a message to the users of watrbx.

                First off, I would like to acknowledge the incredible growth this platform has seen in just the year 2025.
                It's incredible what me and you <i>yes, you</i> were able to pull off.

                We went from just a couple hundred of users to thousands, and thats no small feat.

                While we still are a small site, we have grown <b>a lot</b>

                I really appreciate every piece of user created content. It makes my mind run wild with what else could be created.

                With that out of the way, I want to talk about the future of watrbx.

                As many of you guys know, <b>2013 is being worked on.</b>
                2013 is currently my main goal for watrbx. 2013 will help add a more old feel to it while still having 2016 and the modern features.
                
                The 2013 site is also a lot more refined than the current site (it's kind of a mess)

                but seriously, its a lot faster than this site ever was and im hyped for when it's eventually ready for release.

                I also wanted to note the lack of events and thats partially my fault.

                Whenever I want to make an event, I want it to <b>be special, something unique</b> which makes it hard as a lot of brainstorming has to be done.
                
                I really do wish I could do cool events on watrbx but every time I think of something, its either unoriginal or just not exciting.

                Again, I apologize for the lack of events and I plan to change that if I can. 

                Another goal of mine for watrbx is to keep it running at all costs. <i>(yes, really)</i>
                A lot of other roblox private servers/revivals typically shutdown after a couple of months because of random drama or just a variety of reasons.

                I want watrbx to keep running as long as it possible can, no matter the cost. 
                (doesn't matter how much I lose motivation, get low on server funds, databreaches and much more I will keep this platform running with what I can)
                and I hope <i><b>you</b></i> appreciate that as much as I do, as it gives watrbx <i>history, a timeline, and a purpose.</i>

                Anyways, Merry Christmas and have fun!

                (p.s. I might do something special for people that were active on Christmas/Christmas Eve so stay tuned....)
